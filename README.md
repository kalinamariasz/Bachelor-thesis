# Bachelor's thesis: The Mind (experiment)
This is the code of my Bachelor's thesis (https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/30791/) experiment. The goal of my research was to investigate how well the subjective time perception corresponds to the objective passage of time during strategic interaction in the game The Mind. For that reason, I designed an experiment in which each participant played six games of The Mind with the computer. The computer followed a predefined strategy, and its actions depended on how much time had elapsed since the previous move in the game. This is how the interface of the game looks like:
