both you and the computer will receive 3 cards with a number between 1 and 100. Only your cards are visible to you.

The goal of the game is to cooperate with the computer so that all 6 cards are played in ascending order. You can play your card at any time.  Once you play your card, it will appear \
in the centre of the screen, on the discard pile. You should estimate how long you should wait before playing your lowest card so that if your card is lower, you play it first, but if \
the computerâ€™s card is lower, its card is played first.""")
